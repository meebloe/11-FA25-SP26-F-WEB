# Web Application for the Voiland Food Pantry

## Project Summary

A web application allowing Voiland Food Pantry customers to sign in and volunteers/staff to manage customer analytics, food inventory, and volunteer hours, with associated hardware integration.

### Additional Information

This application aims to take the place of the Food Pantry's physical sign-in sheet to make recording visits and volunteer work simpler and more efficient. To do this, the website will integrate a Cougar Card swiping system with a magstripe reader and an inventory management system with a barcode scanner for ease of use for all types of users. Both customers and staff/administrators will be able to swipe their Cougar Card or use the website to either log their visit or clock in/out. Staff/administrators can update the food inventory database by scanning barcodes associated with food items in the pantry's stock. This will ensure the Food Pantry stock is well-managed and accurate. Food pantry staff/administrators can view, manage, edit, and print records relating to food inventory, pantry visits, and volunteer hours, while customers can access the barcode reader to check out food items.
