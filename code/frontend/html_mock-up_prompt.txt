make an html website with a css file with the following: an index.html with the logo in the top left and a title in the top middle. All pages should have this title and logo image. Use the css to make all text in the entire website the Montserrat font. The title should be the largest text on the page. at the bottom of all the pages should be a note that generative AI was used in making this site. For the index page only, put "hours of operation", "introduction to services" in the center of the page. Under this, put three buttons, hex color #A60F2D in a row. On click the buttons change to hex color #CA1237. Add this button information to the css and use it for all buttons on all the pages. The default background color for the css is #FFFFFF and the default text color is #000000 for all pages. The button on the left links to a page called login.html. The button in the middle is labeled "Customer Scan" and the button on the right is labeled, "Volunteer Scan". These two buttons are toggles for later settings. The page login.html has two textboxes in the center of the page. To the left of the first textbox is the text "Username or Email". To the right of the second textbox is the text "Password". These textbox entries will be connected to a database at a later date. Put a button underneath the login that says, "Volunteer Form". Connect that button to another html called "volunteer_form.html". Put a form in the center of the page. Add four textboxes on the form in a column. To the left of the first textbox is the text "First Name:". To the left of the second textbox is the text "Last Name:", to the left of the third textbox is the text "WSU email:" To the left of the fourth textbox is the text "WSU ID number:". Clicking on the Title on any page should link back to the index.html.
