## What's New (User Facing)
 * Backend and frontend connected to database and running locally
 * Inventory page connected to database
 * Inventory add, delete, and search functionalities implemented
 * Inventory functionalities connected to barcode scanner
 * Student signin page connected to database
 * Student signin and registration functunialities implemented

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 2, our team focused on integrating the frontend and backend components with the database to create a fully functional local environment. We implemented the inventory management system, enabling users to add, delete, search, and track items, and we connected these features to the barcode scanner for streamlined operations. Additionally, we developed the student signin page, including both login and registration workflows, ensuring that new students could enter their year and major while returning students could sign in seamlessly. Throughout this sprint, we navigated challenges related to database connectivity, merge conflicts from integrating different branches, and ensuring consistent data flow between the frontend and backend. These efforts improved our understanding of Spring Boot, Thymeleaf templating, and real-time interaction between the UI and database.

We were able to finish a good portion of developement and demonstrated it to our clients. They were happy with the progress.
