## What's New (User Facing)
 * UI improvements
 * Updated student scan and checkout with barcode scanner
 * Inventory low stock alerts
 * Admin pantry analytics report generation
 * Magstripe reader integration for user login
 * System deployment on client-provided NUC

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 4, our team focused on the goal of 80% feature completion. Features implemented to complete this goal included major updates to previously implemented features, as well as continued hardware integration matching project requirements. Testing and validation was performed both on these new and updated features, as well as workflows between pages to ensure the upkeep of non-functional requirements such as security, performance, usability, and scalability. Edge case analysis and error handling were also performed, allowing our team to deploy the system at its current state on a client-provided NUC to allow our stakeholders to test workflows for direct feedback in future sprints. 

## Unfinished Work
80% feature completion has been achieved. This leaves volunteer features and UI improvements to be the aims of future sprints.
